# Coffeerun-ember

This is an EmberJS version of BNR Guide: Front-End Web Development application for CoffeeRun.  This is a single app running Ember with Bootstrap v4-alpha. The application is an example of porting application patterns from pure JavaScript IIFE module patterns, constructors, prototype inheritance, Promises, and callback patterns.

The port shows EmberJS' conventions for routes, controllers, components, adapters, serializers, helpers, and models.  These conventions will allow for scaling this application from a single form and listing display to a complex system of routes, components, and API integration to expand the CoffeeRun business to an food and beverage empire.
